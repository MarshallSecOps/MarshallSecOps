## 👋 Hi, I'm Marshall
**Cybersecurity Analyst** · Security+ · Network+ · Blue Team Level 1  
Cybersecurity analyst focused on **SOC operations, threat detection, and incident response**. I build hands-on projects that demonstrate real-world security analysis capabilities including **SIEM log analysis, alert triage, threat hunting, endpoint forensics, and detection engineering**.

I approach security problems methodically, document my investigations clearly, and focus on producing actionable outcomes that reduce risk and operational noise.

## 📁 Featured Projects

### 🔹 SOC Detection Engineering Portfolio – Alert Fatigue Reduction
**Detection Engineering & SOC Optimization Project**

A comprehensive portfolio demonstrating production-ready detection improvements across 4 high-volume SOC alerts. Each project shows systematic tuning methodology that reduces false positives while maintaining 100% attack detection coverage.

**What this project demonstrates:**
- Multi-layer detection tuning methodology (whitelisting, behavioral analysis, risk scoring)
- Empirical validation against real attack data (160 confirmed attacks tested)
- Business justification with ROI calculations ($2.89M annual savings)
- Complete SOC documentation (SPL queries, investigation playbooks, escalation criteria)
- Statistical analysis and behavioral detection techniques

**Projects Completed:**
- **PowerShell Execution Detection** – 93.75% alert reduction, parent process analysis
- **Failed Login / Brute Force Detection** – 85.8% alert reduction, success correlation methodology
- **Unusual Network Connections** – 85% alert reduction, beaconing detection via standard deviation
- **Data Exfiltration Detection** – 93.3% alert reduction, DLP integration for data classification

**Combined Impact:**  
89.7% alert reduction (2,950 → 305 alerts/day) · 30.3 FTE freed · 100% true positive retention

**Key takeaway:**  
Demonstrated ability to transform noisy, high-volume detections into operational, high-confidence alerts suitable for enterprise SOC deployment with empirical validation and business impact metrics.

### 🔹 SOC Alert Triage & Escalation Workflow (Splunk)
**SOC Tier 1 / Tier 2 Operational Project**

A structured SOC workflow project demonstrating alert triage, investigation, escalation decision-making, and playbook development using realistic Splunk-based scenarios.

**What this project demonstrates:**
- True positive vs false positive classification
- Alert investigation methodology and consistency
- Escalation criteria with clear Tier 2 handoff context
- SPL investigation queries and alert tuning considerations
- SOC-ready documentation and operational clarity

**Alert Scenarios Covered:**
- Brute force authentication attacks  
- Suspicious PowerShell execution  
- Web application exploitation attempts  
- Data exfiltration via cloud services

### 🔹 APT29 DFIR Investigation – Windows Log Analysis (Splunk)
**Threat Hunting & DFIR Project**

An end-to-end investigation of the APT29 evaluation dataset using Splunk, focused on reconstructing a real-world attack chain from raw Windows telemetry.

**What this project demonstrates:**
- Obfuscated PowerShell payload decoding
- LSASS credential dumping investigation (Mimikatz-style)
- WinRM/WMI lateral movement detection
- Persistence mechanism identification
- Evidence-backed attack timeline reconstruction
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping and DFIR-style reporting

**Key takeaway:**  
Demonstrated ability to reconstruct complex adversary behavior across multiple hosts and attack stages using SIEM telemetry.
