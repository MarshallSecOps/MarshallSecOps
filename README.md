👋 Hi, I’m Marshall

Cybersecurity Analyst • Security+ • Network+ • Blue Team Level 1<br>

Cybersecurity Analyst focused on SOC operations, threat detection, and incident response. I build hands-on projects that demonstrate real-world security analysis capabilities including SIEM log analysis, threat hunting, endpoint forensics, and detection engineering.

I’m a fast learner who stays current with emerging threats through daily industry research and practical lab work, and I enjoy collaborating with others to analyse issues, strengthen processes, and enhance security outcomes. I approach security challenges methodically and document my process thoroughly.
